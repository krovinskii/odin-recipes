Hello World! Hello Odin! Hello Kratos!

This is a project using HTML to display recipes. 
Upon completing this project, I will have demonstrated a basic ability to use HTML to create a very basic webpage with minimal tags. So far I have learned to set up a virtual machine, which I hated both VirtualBox and VMWare as they were slow and laggy. I much prefer WSL2 which I am currently using, although it did take me a bit longer to get going with this because I have to do my own research - but alas I have done it. This is awesome!
