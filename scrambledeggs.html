    <h3 style="text-align: center;"style="text-align: center;">Learn how to make scrambled eggs! With this 5-ingredient recipe, they come out soft, creamy, and flavorful every time. An easy, delicious breakfast.</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;"> Scrambled eggs are one of the little luxuries of everyday life. When I make them, I savor every bite. They’re soft and creamy, rich and flavorful, and they just so happen to 
        cook in under 5 minutes. Seriously, how amazing is that? </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh Eggs</li>
        <li>Milk, plant milk, or water</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil or butter</li>
        <li>Salt…</li>
        <li>And pepper! </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, beat the eggs. Place them in a medium bowl, and whisk until the yolk and whites are thoroughly combined. </li>
        <li>Add the milk or water, and whisk again! The beaten eggs should be an even yellow color, with no translucent spots or streaks.</li>
        <li>Next, gently preheat the pan. Brush a small nonstick skillet with olive oil, or melt a little butter inside it. Warm the skillet over medium heat. </li>
        <li>Finally, cook. Pour in the egg mixture, and let it cook for a few seconds, undisturbed. Then, pull a rubber spatula across the bottom of the pan to form large, soft curds of scrambled eggs.</li>
        <li>While the shortening is heating, dredge a steak in flour to coat; shake off excess. Dip into buttermilk batter; lift up so excess batter drips back into the bowl. Press in flour again to coat both sides completely. Place breaded steak on the wire rack and repeat to bread remaining steaks. </li>
        <li>Continue cooking over medium-low heat, folding and stirring the eggs every few seconds. As you work, make sure to scrape your spatula along the bottom and sides of the pan to continue to form curds and to prevent any part of the eggs from drying out. </li>
        <li>For a soft, creamy scramble, stop when the eggs are mostly set, but a little liquid egg remains. Remove the pan from the heat, and season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>That’s it! The whole process will be over in under 5 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
